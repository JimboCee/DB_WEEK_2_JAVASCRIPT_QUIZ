# DB_WEEK_2_JAVASCRIPT_QUIZ
Week Two Project - Show learning with a quiz made in Javascript, HTML and CSS
Self-reflection: I'm very happy with the result of my JavaScript quiz. Working on the CSS and Front-End are tasks I feel very comfortable working within while elements of Back-End can become somewhat overwhelming leading me to lose focus and make mistakes. In the future, I hope to adapt my code (de-spaghettify) to become more legible for myself and potential collaborators.

Notable faults with the code:

    Scoring system (line 103 game.js - Each question should be worth 100 points, with the max amount of points being 500.
    Pages (Many pages for varying phases of development, planned to compile CSS and javascript into a smaller number of pages

THINGS TO WORK ON IN FUTURE PROJECTS

    Structuring + writing legible code that I can understand day-to-day
    Javascript feature implementation - front&back end
    Get the important work done first -> THEN work on extra features, bells & whistles
